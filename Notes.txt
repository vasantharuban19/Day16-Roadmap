single threaded:- It executes single task at a time.
synchronous:- It will execute all the code line by line in the order which it is written.
Asynchronous:- It will do the task without waiting for a task to complete its execution.

Callback:- It is a function which uses one more function as a parameter.
Example:- MRF , addEventListener
arr.map(()=>{

})
div.addEventListener("click",()=>{

})

//CallStack :- 
=>It is a place where it keeps track of the function 
that has to be called inside the program.
=>It will execute whaterver statements inside the program.

//WebApi:-
=> It is the place where Asynchronous operations are actually executed.

//Queue:-
=>Queue is a data structure (FIFO) 
=>It stores all the async function which has to be executed next.

//EventLoop:- 
=> It is between callstack and Queue
=> the main role of the event loop is to check whether callstack is empty or not.
=>If it is empty it will push the code from queue and pass it to callstack
=>then the callstack executes it.
